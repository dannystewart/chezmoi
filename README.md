# dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repo. These are maintained using [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/). Check out Chezmoi's [user guide](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/command-overview/) for an explanation of how everything is laid out. Sensitive files like SSH keys and environment variables are encrypted using Chezmoi's [age encryption](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/encryption/age/).
